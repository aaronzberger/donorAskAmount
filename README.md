## Setup

To run any of the notebooks in `/src` on a local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the resulting directory.
2. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment. If you are using Linux or MacOS, run `source venv/bin/activate`. If you are using Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
4. Install all dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. You may now open JupyterLab or view the notebooks in VS Code. Make sure the `venv` kernel is selected.
