Your final milestone project submission should have the following components:

    Video presentation

    Code notebook

üìΩÔ∏è Video Instructions:

All team members should take part in the presentation. The idea is to have every team member present a part of the project.

Information that should be present in your presentation:

    Problem Statement

    Visualization/EDA/Analysis

    Modeling

    Training details: Time taken, number of epochs, batch size, learning rate etc.

    Results

    Conclusion/ Inferences

    Future Work/ Scope of improvement 

Note: it is also acceptable to gloss over some of these items in the video saying, "refer to the notebook report for more details on 'x'." But viewers should leave your video with a clear understanding of your problem, the methods you decided to pursue and why, as well as your results, their interpretation and what would be future work were the project to continue. 

‚è≥ Time Limit for video presentation is 6 minutes. Videos will not be played after 6 minutes. Do not speed up recordings in an attempt to get the video under the limit.
üìä Presentation Instructions (Pavlos' 10 commandments):

    Instead of reading from a script, practice your presentation at least three times to develop a natural flow and pay attention to your intonation.

    Avoid creating "NPC" slides or slides that do not contribute to the overall message of your presentation. Make every slide count, and be sure to talk about each slide.

    Check the audio quality and make sure there is no background noise.

    Be sure to include slide numbers in your presentation.

    Keep the font sizes consistent throughout your presentation, and use no more than three different fonts. Highlight only essential keywords and avoid unnecessary capitalization.

    Edit and smooth the transitions between slides, and consider the aesthetics, such as using colors.

    Avoid using slides that are too text-heavy. Split the information onto multiple slides or ensure a balance between text and white space.

    Introduce your teammates and use "we" instead of "I" to show that the presentation is a team effort.

    Try to stay within the given time constraints for the presentation.

    Be excited about your project! Engage with the audience and convey the highlights of your efforts.

üìí Notebook Instructions:

    The notebook should read like a report with appropriate comments and explanations.

    Include TOC (table of content) 

    Describe the organization of the codes.

    Include an illustration/flow chart of your model. They can also be used for your presentation.

    Make sure an explanation follows every visualization.

    Describe what libraries your codes depend on.

    If your codes require specific environment configurations, make sure to explain them.

    You can move additional code to utility .py files or an appendix notebook if it helps make the main report notebook more concise.

üîé General Expectations:

Here are a few of the things the course staff will be considering when evaluating the final milestone submissions:

Video Presentation

    Technical content

    Style and organization (e.g., slides or lack there of)

    Effectiveness and clarity of presentation

Notebook Report

    Motivation, context, and framing of the problem

    Description of the data, how data was handled

    EDA specific to report's content

    Modeling approach, logical description of modeling decisions and process

    Results: drawing reasonable conclusions & speculations, addressing strengths, limitations, and future works

    Overall communication and clarity: good visuals, minimal typos, readability

    Coding efficiency and style

    Depth and thoroughness

üèÜ Evaluations

Don't forget to complete the self & peer evaluations assignment on Canvas once your group has submitted the final milestone. Each group member will need to complete the evaluations individually.
